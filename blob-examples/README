This directory contains SMART data of bad or weird drives for testing
purposes.  Generated with "skdump --save". File name should follow the
format "MODEL--FIRMWARE". Also, replace spaces by underscores ('_') so
that these files can be handled properly by automake.

If you add another snapshot here, make sure to edit ../Makefile.am so
that it is included in the tarball.
